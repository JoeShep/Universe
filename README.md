Universe
=====================
all the schools in your orbit

Purpose
-------

This is a project for the Unit 2 (Ruby on Rails) portion of the Nashville Software School Software Development Fundamentals course. It is an adaptation/continuation of CollegeTrax, my Ruby-only command line app project from earlier in the course.

The contstraints of the project are that it must use Ruby on Rails, PostgresQL, and be deployed on Heroku.

The goal of this project is to create a visit log and ranking system for high school students who are visiting colleges and universities as part of the application process.

Many students visit multiple schools, sometimes over a very short period of time, sometimes with long stretches between visits. Both scenarios can make it hard to remember what a student liked or disliked about a particular school. This app will help the user keep track of each visit and allow the user to see how the schools compare to each other in the areas of greatest importance, as weighted by the user.
